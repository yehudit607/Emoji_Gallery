## Emoji Gallery
## Overview

The Emoji Gallery is a backend service designed to enable users to add predefined emojis to their movie projects. It supports different tiers of users with varying levels of access to emoji resources.

### Features

- **Emoji Gallery**: Users can browse and select from a collection of in-house emojis.
- **User Uploads**: Users can upload their own emojis to reuse in future projects.
- **Emoji Management**: The system allows certain users to upload a limited or unlimited number of emojis based on their subscription tier.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Python 3.8+
- Redis

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone [repository URL]
Navigate to the project directory:
sh
Copy code
cd emoji-gallery
Build and run the project using Docker Compose:
sh
Copy code
docker-compose up --build
Usage
Once the server is running, you can access the following API endpoints:

GET /gallery/: Retrieve a paginated list of emojis available in the gallery.
POST /emoji/: Upload a new user emoji (with different limits based on user tier).
GET /user/{user_id}/emojis/: Retrieve a list of emojis uploaded by a specific user.
System Design
[Insert system design diagram here]

Components
Client: The frontend interface that interacts with the user.
API Server (FastAPI): Handles all client requests and serves the appropriate emoji resources.
Redis: Utilized for caching and managing rate-limiting to ensure API performance under load.
Database: Stores user data and emoji metadata.
Scalability
This service is built with scalability in mind, leveraging technologies such as:

FastAPI: For a high-performance, asynchronous API that scales with ease.
Docker: To containerize the application, ensuring consistent deployments.
Redis: For high-speed data access and rate limiting, reducing load on the database.
Tests
Run the automated tests for this system:

sh
Copy code
docker-compose run app pytest
Deployment
For a complete production deployment, consider implementing:

Microservices Architecture: Separation of the user emoji and gallery emoji into separate services.
Load Balancer: To distribute incoming traffic and ensure high availability.
CDN: For serving emoji images efficiently to users worldwide.
S3 (or equivalent): To store and manage emoji images.
Message Queue: To handle asynchronous tasks and decouple service dependencies.
